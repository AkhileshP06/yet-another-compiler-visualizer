If you are trying to run yacv onto any of the WSL distributions like Debian Ubuntu or Kali, then please follow  the following instructions in order to install and successfully run yacv in your WSL distro. The reason benhind  this is that inorder to keep size as small as possible WSL distros only have all the esstial linux files installed all the other files you have to manually install.

This instructions are based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS WSL. Please change them as per your python installed version.

Instructions For WSL: 
1) sudo apt-get install python3-pip
2) sudo apt-get install python3-cairo-dev
3) pip3 install pycairo
4) sudo apt-get install libsdl-pango-dev
5) After this try running command pip3 install manim if it runs successfully then you are all set. Otherwise you will have to debug the error and install other packages as required.
6) sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev
7) sudo apt-get install graphviz-dev
8) sudo apt-get install python3-pygraphviz
9)sudo apt-get install python3-pygraphviz-dbg
10) After this you will have to install latex packages. You can do that by running command sudo apt-get install texlive-full. Please note that this command requires 5.5 GB of free disk space. If you are low on space you can install yacv and then as it starts giving errors like this latex font not found, etc you can install only those packages.
11) sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

12) After this please follow the instructions given in the README.md of this project with one exception, Instead of using pip use pip3.

Also after you successfully install yacv and it gives error that command not found then you will have to add the installed path of yacv in the Ubuntu PATH variable. By default, yacv is installed in the follwing directoru=y /home/<your username>/.local/bin. You can add this into the PATH by following command.
export PATH=$PATH:/home/<your username>/.local/bin
